- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handlePress, handleSubmit)
- Use PascalCase for components and their file names
- Do not make IProps interfaces, inline the type definition in the function declaration.
- For components that will not be reused, create a ./\_components/ directory next to the page.
- Use Tailwind v4 classes for styling.
- Always use the cn() utility instead of string interpolation.
- Always perfer flexbox over grid.
- Always use gap-_ instead of space-_ classes.
- No `eval`, `innerHTML`, or script injection patterns
- Use React hooks properly; exhaustive-deps is enforced

- Use `@cmdniels/uikit` for reusable components (shadcn/baseui based library)
- Import components directly: `import { Button, Input, Dialog } from "@cmdniels/uikit"`
- Common components available: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Label, Dialog, AlertDialog, DatePicker, FileDropzone, LinkInput, Badge, Error, Toaster
