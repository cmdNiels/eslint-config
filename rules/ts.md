- Write concise, readable, functional code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Ignore all eslint related warnings as these will get fixed on save from the user

- Dont use dynamic imports.
- Remove unused imports automatically
- Enforce `@/` alias for imports from root
- Enforce one default export per file
- Never include multiple exports in a file
- Enforce a single function per file
- Reusable types should be placed as default exports inside of @/types
- Constants should always be placed in @/lib/constants.ts
- For console apps with state use @/lib/state.ts with a object default export
- Enforce a single IType per IType.ts in @/types
- Dont use or create a @/src directory use @/lib
- Never make new root directories.

- Files should always have the same name as the default export
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Use lowercase for directories (lib/feature/defaultExport.ts)
- Use IPascalCase for types and interfaces and their file names
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Always prefix interfaces with I (e.g. IConfig)
- Double quotes, no template literals for static strings

- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Avoid enums; use const objects/maps instead
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation
- No explicit `any`; use `unknown` if necessary with proper narrowing
- Use the nullish coalescing operator (??) instead of logical OR (||)
- Never use classes.
- Always add types to callback parameters (void(param1, (param: IType) => {}))
